AriaDeploy "Installer"

Ask:
extract to folder (installer scenario)
-if so also ask to share path automatically (create temp user)
-and input credentials into credetnails.txt
-ask to install FTP server (?)
ask to build pe images


Extract contents to specified folder 
(default if exist D:, D:\workspace\AriaDeploy
else %userprofile%\desktop\AriaDeploy 
or c:\workspace\AriaDeploy)

create network share if installer scenario
-remove if already exists, 

-can build pe from kits for deployment on a stick scenarios
-2 modes? 1) normal installer mode
(needed for larger deployments with persistent settings and to install drivers(?))
2) deployment on a stick mode
reccomended for small (1-15) deployments and testing
-or both

detect the kits

detect if installed
1)
registry
SET KitsRootRegValueName=KitsRoot81
SET KitsRootRegValueName=KitsRoot10
HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows Kits\Installed Roots
FOR /F "skip=2 tokens=2*" %%i IN ('REG QUERY "%regKeyPath%" /v %KitsRootRegValueName%') DO (SET KitsRoot=%%j)
SET DandIRoot=%KitsRoot%Assessment and Deployment Kit\Deployment Tools
2) (lower priority) installation default)
no reg settings for AIK for Win7, so just check at
C:\Program Files\Windows AIK
C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1
C:\Program Files\Windows Kits\8.1
C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10
C:\Program Files\Windows Kits\10
then make sure pe components are also found

mount the default image, 
update the drivers, components and scripts (and maybe background)

then capture .wim (name appropriately) and then turn .wim into .isos

maybe get a better FTP server?, command line one would be ideal
"ftpd install service" or w/e, copy ftpd.ini to c:\program files\ftp\fptd.ini
Could set up FTP server automatically that way
