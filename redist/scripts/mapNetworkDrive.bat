::1) test if addresses exist
::2) try to ftp to valid addresses to fetch drive path mapping information and credentials file
::3) extract credentials
::4) map network drive
::5) test to see if mapped - if failed, tell user to do it manually

::0 means success, 1 means error (default). Could also just check FTP availability instead. But how?
