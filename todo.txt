UI:
NewFunct: index button should run dism /get-imageinfo and also /index: with the current index

WinPE:
NewFunct: add WMI + to support automatic detection of model drivers (using addDrivers.bat for PE or integrate directly into client) -needs testing
NewFunct: create windowsPE autogenerate script (see below under deployment)
UI: write/rewrite some functionality scripts for win PE (info, start, help, ls, list) -inProgress (but on hold for concept art)

deployment:
Docs: create diagram showing AiraDeploy server and clients interacting to transfer the .wim file in pretty picture format
NewFunct: It should be possible to re-seed an existing torrent after closing aria initially -sorta done
NewFunct: create torrent file for drivers in server for install scenario (Dell_Latittude e6220_win10_x64.torrent)
-maybe, "specifyManufacturerAndModelAndCreateDriversTorrent" or "createDriversTorrent"=false by default
-this option is incompatible with archiveDrivers due to possible driver conflicts, so inform and ask user to resolve
"warning both archiveDrivers and createDriversTorrent are enabled, only 1 is supported per deployment"
"ArchiveDrivers is for single target hardware deployments"
"createDriversTorrent is advanced functionality for heterogenous hardware deployments and requires WMI enabled winPE images"
"Enter 1 to deploy drivers as an archive or 2 to createDriversTorrent instead"
-ask for user Manufacturer and model, repeat until correct, can take the architecture and os version from image
-also need to test py3createtorrent to see how well it handles directories
UI/Rewrite: create stand alone redistributable package (remove DISM/unattend.xml and bundle seperately) -mostly done
-dependency NewFunct: formalize deployment on a stick scenario 
--should autodetect .wim images, and \drivers folder (turn on simpledriverdeployment)
--allow the user to pick unattend file type, and should autodetect any .xml files at the root (as custom)
--needs to auto-start py3bt_tracker/aria/ftp server and ariadeploy.bat
--should have prebuilt client/server isos (maybe just 1 and switch between two modes)
--should it auto-support PXE? maybe with a cross platform pxe server? uefi support?
-dependency NewFunct: formalize installation-based scenario (with u/qTorrent?)
--This is going to lend itself more to a uTorrent/qTorrent GUI manager for all the .wim images being deployed
--although aira as seeder should still work, would need to update client deployment name
--and client side detection code in order to ask user which .wim to deploy (similar to autoimage)
-dependency NewFunct: write an optional-ish installer (bat + req 7zip or 7z self exe or packaged installer?)
--it should also remove any existing folders and recreate them, create .pe images, ask to install aria deploy (enables option: create temp account+psw), set up ftp
Docs: Dia control flow diagram -mostlydone, but needs updating and trademark logo
NewFunct: integrate addDrivers.bat functionality as downloading client\resources\drivers\dell_latittude e6220_win7_x86_drivers.torrent into client -need to test
Rewrite: add native 32-bit deployment capabilities AriaDeploy.bat (resources\x64, x86 folders) -need to test
NewFunct: add a private torrent flag, would be kinda nice -need to test
Rewrite: detect resuming in an GPT->MBR switched scenario, as in if the restart partition table format doesn't match the one -humm
-required by the current boot mode, then start over completely (repartition+redownload)
Rewrite: verpose copy from-to in scripts (for client especially)
Docs: write better documentation regarding options in deploy.ini
Rewrite: if client is set to prompt, display current hard disk configuration
Rewrite: maybe could mark targettemplocation as hidden and system, maybe modify permissions for it (root folder)
Bug: using AriaDeploy.exe always starts a 32-bit cmd prompt (check @comspec configuration)

autoimage:
Bug: detects boot.wims as deployable images (if .wim is <1gb in size toss it out)
Bug: if no images found, there should be no output (no errors)
Bug: erase previously selected image enviornmental variable on screen #2 when going back
UI: improve user interface of final screen (How it looks depends on if complex flag was triggered), remove PE info
UI: make controls and bi-directionality of script more Clear, and on every screen

Bugs tools:
Bug: convertwim (old?) (from flash drive) using winpe v5 x64 doesn't uefi boot when converted to iso (from misc) (180mb vs 225mb)
-dependency Rewrite: fully isolate existing winPE mgmt scripts (create portable, clickable environment) and integrate into portableTools
NewFunct: bcdAddPE should allow adding to tools menu on isos\usbs (workaround to multiple boot menus)

Presentation:
NewFunct: add slide on windows PE -need to update
NewFunct: Add suggested image authoring station to presentation (HyperV?)
NewFunct: description of MDT
Docs: add MDTShare\Scripts\LiteTouch.vbs to workflow diagram explicitly
Rewrite: detailed Workflow for generic capture image scenario (rtm->import win7x64_retailDVD)
-also: figure out why it has that weird dependency, prolly an "just in case" dependency
Docs: Add control flow diagrams to presentation
Docs: Add suggested usageGuide for MDT/Scripts -scripts as another extension of MDT in certain scenarios
NewFunct: Add suggested deployment architecture to presentation (incl scalability, separating out, having multiple seeder(s))

Add "layers and interlopability slide" to system design presentation concluding that shims are commonly added to ensure backwards compatability, -define interlopability and formalize the concept of an "interface"

Misc:
humm: windows 10 recovery
NewFunct: windows 8 recovery
backport: update windows 7 misc

Long Term:
create GUI frontend? -partiallydone, any other ones needed?, compress into single installer to perserve folder structure or add "info wim" functionality to GUI
Macs? (dism/winpe not licensed for use deploying non windows OSs so would need complete re-write)
