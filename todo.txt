UI:
Bug: AriaDeploy.exe does not show image file in GUI if name is too long (2nd line, should scroll instead) -done
Bug: AriaDeploy.exe can mess up typing settings if user presses a key in the middle of the transfer (should transfer entire line immediately) -done
Bug: server 2012 cmd box case sensitive (start cmd prompt with command to run in it directly) -done
Bug: it should not clobber itself post deployment (or freeze randomly-prolly only when being compiled dynamicly) -done
Bug: Windows should be child-windows not fully independent to prevent multiple-clicking -done
NewFunct: index button should run dism /get-imageinfo and also /index with the current index

WinPE:
NewFunct: add WMI support and windowsPE autoinstall + detection of drivers (using addDrivers.bat)
-dependency: rewrite update.bat to autoinstall WMI packages into WinPE (3,4?,5,10)
UI: write/rewrite some functionality scripts for win PE (info, start, help, ls, list) -inProgress (but on hold for concept art)

Misc:
humm: windows 10 recovery
NewFunct: windows 8 recovery
backport: update windows 7 misc

autoimage:
Bug: detects boot.wims as deployable images (if .wim is <1gb in size toss it out)
Bug: if no images found, there should be no output (no errors)
Bug: erase previously selected image enviornmental variable on screen #2 when going back
UI: improve user interface of final screen (How it looks depends on if complex flag was triggered), remove PE info
UI: make controls and bi-directionality of script more Clear, and on every screen

deployment:
Bug: parsedfullfolderpath in drivers always shows wrong info or invalid unattend.xml tries to copy (can trigger using driver path with spaces and no quotes)
NewFunct: integrate addDrivers.bat functionality as downloading client\resources\drivers\dell_latittude e6220_win7_x86_drivers.torrent into client
Docs: create full control flow diagram using Dia -mostlydone, but needs updating and trademark logo
UI/Rewrite: create stand alone redistributable package (remove DISM/unattend.xml) -done
NewFunct: write an optional installer.bat to remove any existing folders and recreate them (maybe) -requires 7zip
Docs: write documentation regarding options in deploy.ini
Docs: write documentation regarding licensing information -done
Rewrite: if client prompts, display current hard disk configuration
Rewrite: add native 32-bit deployment capabilities AriaDeploy.bat (resources\x64, x86 folders) -need to test
NewFunct: add a private torrent flag, would be kinda nice -need to test
NewFunct: It should be possible to re-seed an existing torrent after closing aria initially
Rewrite: verpose copy from-to in scripts (for client especially)
Rewrite: detect resuming in an GPT->MBR switched scenario, as in if the restart partition table format doesn't match the one -humm
-required by the current boot mode, then start over completely (repartition+redownload)
Rewrite: maybe could mark targettemplocation as hidden and system, maybe modify permissions for it
Bug: when reading settings from file, the only settings not read in should be those not commented out, for eol=: -done

Bugs tools:
Bug: convertwim (old?) (from flash drive) using winpe v5 x64 doesn't uefi boot when converted to iso (from misc) (180mb vs 225mb)
-dependency before "fix" possible: fully isolate existing winPE mgmt scripts (create portable, clickable 
-environment) and integrate into portableTools alongside convertWIM
NewFunct: bcdAddPE should allow adding to tools menu on isos\usbs (workaround to multiple boot menus)

Presentation:
NewFunct: add slide on windows PE -need to update
NewFunct: Add suggested image authoring station to presentation (HyperV?)
NewFunct: description of MDT
Docs: add MDTShare\Scripts\LiteTouch.vbs to workflow diagram explicitly
Rewrite: detailed Workflow for generic capture image scenario (rtm->import win7x64_retailDVD)
-also: figure out why it has that weird dependency
Docs: Add control flow diagrams to presentation
Docs: Add suggested usageGuide for MDT/Scripts -scripts as another extension of MDT in certain scenarios
NewFunct: Add suggested deployment architecture to presentation (incl scalability, separating out, having multiple seeder(s))

Long Term:
create GUI frontend? -partiallydone, any other ones needed?, compress into single installer to perserve folder structure or add "info wim" functionality to GUI
Macs? (dism/winpe not licensed for use deploying non windows OSs so would need complete re-write)
